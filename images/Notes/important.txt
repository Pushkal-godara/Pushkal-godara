1-- Validation{parameter validation}.

2-- Formatting/Transforming parameters.

3-- Logic implementation{If/Else(condition...), etc.}.

4-- Check Query and Query-Result{If output need to be modified or not}.


Note:---
- First of all follow above steps before doing any change inside your code, Do rough work in a note book.
- Try to keep code short and do not directly change code without proper validation.
- Try to be more specific while asking questions with chatGPT.
- Connection:-(DRIVER)
             * Specify the type of App. you are building(Node.js, React.js, etc..).
	     * Note that front-end side JS runs on browsers(like back-end JS runs on nodeJS), but now a days to make it easy/managable we use frame-works
		 for front-end like ReactJS, AngularJS, etc,..
             * Type of Database you are using.
             * Then specify the npm module you want to use for making connection between your App and Database:{Also know as "< Database Drivers >"}
                   (Ex: for MySQL DB ----> npm module "mysql" or "mysql2"
                        for Postgresql DB ----> npm module "pg"). 
            

- ORM:- 
       * To run queries we use orm which act as a communication bridge between our App & DB.
       * For example: 
                    => "Sequelize" is widely-used and feature-rich ORM for Node.js that supports multiple database systems, including MySQL,Postgresql,etc..
                    => "TypeORM" is an ORM that supports TypeScript and JavaScript and can be used with various databases, including MySQL, Postgresql,etc.. 

- Driver: A low-level software component specific to a particular database management system that enables communication between an application and that
          database.
- Adapter: In some contexts, an adapter can refer to a higher-level abstraction that provides a unified interface for interacting with different databases, 
           often building on top of specific drivers.
- Connector: A term that is used interchangeably with "driver" or "adapter," representing a software component that facilitates the connection and 
           communication between an application and a specific database.
